MyMap::associate()
If MyMap holds N nodes, and the Nodes are ordered, then the function will take O(logN) time on average. It takes O(logN) time to find a spot in MyMap to insert an association and one step to insert it.

MyMap::find()
If MyMap holds N nodes and MyMap is ordered, then the function will take O(logN) time to find the key, because it traverses through half the nodes (1/2 N) in the worst case scenario to find the node with the desired key.

AttractionMapper::init()
If MapLoader holds S Street Segments, and each Street Segment has A attractions on average, then the runtime of the function is O(SAlogA).

AttractionMapper::getGeoCoord()
If attractionMap, a map of strings to GeoCoords, holds N mappings, then the runtime of this function is O(logN). It takes O(logN) time to find something in an ordered map.

SegmentMapper::init()
If a MapLoader object has S StreetSegments  on average, with an average of A attractions on each of the segments, then the runtime would be ((S+A)log(S+A)).

SegmentMapper::getSegments()
If a MapLoader object has S StreetSegments  on average, with an average of A attractions on each of the segments, then the runtime would be (log(S+A)).

Navigator::navigate()
I didnâ€™t finish the implementation of this function unfortunately.
